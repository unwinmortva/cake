The Wheel of Time is one of the most popular and influential fantasy series of all time. It was written by Robert Jordan, who died in 2007 before completing the final book. The series was finished by Brandon Sanderson, who used Jordan's notes and outlines. The series consists of 14 books and a prequel, totaling over 4 million words and 12,000 pages. The series has sold over 80 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 34 languages. It has also inspired many spin-offs, such as video games, role-playing games, board games, and a forthcoming TV series by Amazon Studios.
 
The story of The Wheel of Time is set in a world where magic exists, but only certain people can use it. These people are called channelers, and they can tap into the One Power, a force that drives the Wheel of Time, a cyclical concept of history and destiny. The One Power is divided into two halves: saidin, used by men, and saidar, used by women. However, saidin was tainted by the Dark One, a primordial evil that opposes the Creator, and caused male channelers to go insane and destroy the world in an event known as the Breaking of the World. Since then, only female channelers have been accepted and trained by an organization called the Aes Sedai, while male channelers are hunted down and gentled, a process that cuts them off from the One Power and leads to their death.
