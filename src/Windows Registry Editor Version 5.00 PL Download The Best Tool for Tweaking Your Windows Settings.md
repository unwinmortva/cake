## Windows Registry Editor Tips and Tricks
 
Windows Registry Editor is not only a tool for viewing and modifying the registry, but also a powerful way to customize your Windows experience and optimize your system performance. There are many hidden settings and features that you can access and tweak with the help of the registry editor. However, you should always be careful when editing the registry, as any mistake can cause serious problems for your system. Always make a backup of your registry before making any changes. To do so, click on File > Export and save the entire registry as a .reg file. To restore the backup, double-click on the .reg file and confirm the merge.
 
Here are some of the best tips and tricks for using Windows Registry Editor:

- Add Command Prompt to Context Menu: If you want to quickly open a command prompt window in any folder location, you can add a shortcut to the context menu that appears when you right-click on a folder. To do this, navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\cmd` in the registry editor and change the permissions of the `cmd` key to give yourself full control. Then, rename the value `HideBasedOnVelocityId` to `_HideBasedOnVelocityId` or delete it. Now you will see a Command Prompt option when you right-click on any folder[^1^].
- Revert to Windows 10-style Start Menu: If you don't like the new Windows 11-style start menu, you can revert to the old Windows 10-style start menu with a simple registry tweak. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced` and create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `Start_ShowClassicMode`. Set its value data to 1 and restart your system. You will see the familiar Windows 10 start menu again[^2^].
- Increase Network Speeds: If you want to boost your network speeds by optimizing some settings related to TCP/IP protocol, you can try this registry hack. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters` and create four new DWORD (32-bit) values named `TcpAckFrequency`, `TcpDelAckTicks`, `TcpNoDelay`, and `TcpInitialRTT`. Set their value data to 1, 0, 1, and 3 respectively. Restart your system and enjoy faster network speeds[^3^].
- Use Windows Photo Viewer Instead of Photos App: If you prefer the old Windows Photo Viewer over the new Photos app for viewing images, you can enable it with a registry hack. Navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Applications\\photoviewer.dll` and create a new key named `shell`. Under this key, create another key named `open`. Under this key, create another key named `command`. Double-click on the default value in the right pane and set its value data to `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\rundll32.exe \"%ProgramFiles%\\Windows Photo Viewer\\PhotoViewer.dll\", ImageView_Fullscreen %1`. Now you can set Windows Photo Viewer as your default image viewer[^3^].
- Disable Windows Lockscreen: If you find the lockscreen annoying and want to skip it when you boot up or wake up your system, you can disable it with a registry hack. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows` and create a new key named `Personalization`. Under this key, create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `NoLockScreen`. Set its value data to 1 and restart your system. You will no longer see the lockscreen[^3^].
- Show Detailed Information on Startup: If you want to see more information about what is happening behind the scenes when your system is starting up, such as drivers loading, services starting, etc., you can enable verbose mode with a registry hack. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System` and create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `
