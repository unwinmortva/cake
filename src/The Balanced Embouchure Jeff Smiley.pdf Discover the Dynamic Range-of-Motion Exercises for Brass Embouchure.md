# The Balanced Embouchure: A Revolutionary Method for Brass Players by Jeff Smiley
 
If you are a brass player who wants to improve your embouchure, tone, range, endurance, and flexibility, you may be interested in The Balanced Embouchure by Jeff Smiley. This book is a self-help guide that teaches you a new approach to brass development based on universal principles that work for everyone.
 
The Balanced Embouchure (BE) is not a traditional method that relies on vague or inflexible techniques. Instead, it focuses on the mechanics of the embouchure - the lips, tongue, and air - and how they interact to produce different registers and qualities of sound. BE also emphasizes the importance of learning by doing, rather than overanalyzing or imitating.
