## Step 3: Add repos and search for packages
 
To download Cydia deb files, you need to add repos (sources) that host them. Cyder 3 comes with some pre-added repos, but you can also add your own by clicking on the + button on the Repositories tab. You can enter the repo URL manually or copy and paste it from a web browser. After adding a repo, click on the Reload button to update its packages.
 
To search for packages, go to the Packages tab and enter the package name or keyword in the search box. You can also filter the packages by category, repo, or status (installed or not). To view more details about a package, double-click on it or right-click and select View Details. You will see a pop-up window with information such as description, version, size, dependencies, conflicts, etc.
 
## Step 4: Download packages and their dependencies
 
To download a package, right-click on it and select Download Package. If the package has any dependencies (other packages that are required for it to work), you will see a confirmation dialog asking if you want to download them as well. Click Yes to download all the dependencies along with the package.
 
You can also download multiple packages at once by selecting them with Ctrl or Shift keys and right-clicking and selecting Download Selected Packages. You can view the download progress and status on the Downloads tab. You can also pause, resume, or cancel downloads from there.
 
## Step 5: Transfer downloaded packages to your iOS device
 
After downloading the packages, you need to transfer them to your iOS device and install them with Cydia. To do this, go to the Settings tab and click on the Transfer button. You will see a list of downloaded packages that are ready to be transferred. Select the ones you want to transfer and click on Start Transfer.
 
Cyder 3 will create a folder named AutoInstall in your device's root directory (/var/root/Media/Cydia/AutoInstall) and copy the downloaded deb files there. You will see a confirmation message when the transfer is complete.
 
## Step 6: Reboot your iOS device and install packages with Cydia
 
The final step is to reboot your iOS device and launch Cydia. Cydia will automatically detect the deb files in the AutoInstall folder and install them for you. You will see a message saying "Installing downloaded debs
