## How to Boot from the Disk
 
To boot from the disk, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings. You can access these settings by pressing a specific key (usually F2, F10, F12, or Del) during the startup screen. Look for the option that lets you choose the boot device or priority and select your USB flash drive.
 
If your computer supports UEFI mode, you may need to disable Secure Boot and enable Legacy or CSM mode in order to boot from the disk. You can find these options in the Security or Boot tab of your BIOS or UEFI settings.
 
After changing the settings, save and exit and your computer should boot from the disk.
