## What is BIOS and why unlock it?
 
BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System, and it is a firmware that controls the hardware settings and boot sequence of your laptop. The BIOS also contains some advanced settings that are hidden by default, such as CPU voltage, memory timings, fan speed, etc. These settings can be accessed by pressing a certain key (usually F2 or Del) during the boot process, which will bring up the BIOS menu.
 
Unlocking the BIOS means modifying the firmware to reveal the hidden settings, which can give you more control and flexibility over your laptop's performance. For example, you can overclock your CPU or GPU to boost your gaming experience, or undervolt your components to reduce heat and power consumption. However, unlocking the BIOS also comes with some risks, such as bricking your laptop or damaging your hardware if you change the wrong settings or encounter a power failure during the update process. Therefore, you should only unlock the BIOS if you know what you are doing and take proper precautions.

4. The update process will take a few minutes and will reboot your laptop automatically. Do not interrupt the process or turn off your laptop during this time.
5. After rebooting, press F2 or Del to enter the BIOS menu. You should see some new tabs and options that were previously hidden. Congratulations, you have successfully unlocked the BIOS of Alienware M18x R1 with A05 version!
