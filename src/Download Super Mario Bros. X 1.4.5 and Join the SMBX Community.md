One of the most recent versions of SMBX is 1.4, which adds new features such as custom graphics, NPCs, power-ups, and more. However, this version is not officially supported by the SMBX team, and is considered a fan-made modification. Therefore, you will not find it on the official website of SMBX.
 
If you want to download Super Mario Bros. X 1.4, you will need to find a reliable source that hosts the files. One possible source is this link[^2^], which offers a zip file containing the game and some extra content. You will need to unzip the file and run the executable to install the game.
 
Alternatively, you can download Super Mario Bros. X 2 (SMBX2), which is an official fork of SMBX that includes many features from 1.4 and more. You can find it here[^1^]. This fork also has a launcher that lets you update the game and download additional content.
 
Whichever version you choose, you will be able to enjoy a great Mario fangame that lets you unleash your creativity and have fun with your favorite characters.
  
Super Mario Bros. X is not just a game, but also a level editor that lets you create your own worlds and scenarios. You can use the built-in editor to place tiles, blocks, enemies, items, and more. You can also import custom graphics and sounds to make your levels more unique.
 
You can also play levels made by other users, or share your own creations online. There are many websites and forums where you can find and download SMBX levels, such as Super Mario Bros. X Forums or Super Mario Bros. X Wiki. You can also join the SMBX Discord server to chat with other players and creators.
