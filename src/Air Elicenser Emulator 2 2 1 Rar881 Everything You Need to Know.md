# Air Elicenser Emulator 2 2 1 Rar881: A Tool for Music Software Users
 
Air Elicenser Emulator 2 2 1 Rar881 is a software that claims to emulate the eLicenser Control Center, a utility that allows for managing music software licenses by a variety of manufacturers. The eLicenser Control Center enables users to download and store licenses on a USB-eLicenser (dongle, license key) or in a Soft-eLicenser (virtual license container on hard disk). Many licenses can also be transferred to other eLicensers via the eLicenser Control Center[^4^].
