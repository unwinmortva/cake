Panels and plugins are extensions that add new features and functions to Photoshop. They can help you save time, improve your workflow, and unleash your creativity. In this article, we'll show you some of the best panels and plugins for Photoshop that you can use in 2023.
 
## What are Panels and Plugins?
 
Panels and plugins are two types of extensions that you can install in Photoshop to enhance its capabilities. Panels are user interface elements that provide quick access to tools, settings, and commands. Plugins are software components that perform specific tasks or effects on your images.
 
Some panels and plugins are built-in to Photoshop, while others are developed by third-party developers and require installation. You can find panels and plugins for various purposes, such as photo editing, graphic design, typography, animation, 3D modeling, and more.
 
## How to Install Panels and Plugins?
 
The installation process for panels and plugins may vary depending on the source and format of the extension. However, here are some general steps that you can follow:
 
1. Download the panel or plugin file from the official website or a trusted source. It may come as a ZIP file that you need to extract.
2. Create a folder on your computer to store all your Photoshop panels and plugins. Copy the downloaded files to this folder.
3. Open Photoshop and go to Edit > Preferences > Plugins.
4. Check the box that says "Additional Plugins Folder" and then locate your new folder on your computer. Click OK.
5. Restart Photoshop to enable the new panel or plugin. You may need to activate it from the Window menu or the Filters menu.
