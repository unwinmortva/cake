Anchor bolt chairs are structures that are used to distribute the load from anchor bolts to the shell of a tubular column or tank. They are necessary to prevent excessive bending and stress in the shell, especially when the anchor bolts are not aligned with the shell axis. Anchor bolt chairs are made of carbon or alloy steel and consist of a top plate, vertical plates, and welds. The design of anchor bolt chairs should follow the guidelines given in *AISI E 1, Volume II, Part VII*, which are summarized below.
 
## Top Plate
 
The top plate is the horizontal plate that connects the vertical plates and supports the anchor bolt. The top plate should have a width *a* along the shell and a length *b* in the radial direction. The thickness *c* of the top plate should be sufficient to resist bending and shear stress between the hole and the free edge of the plate. The hole for the anchor bolt should have a diameter *d* and an eccentricity *e* from the shell centerline. The minimum eccentricity *e<sub>min</sub>* should be based on a heavy hex nut clearing the shell by 1/2 in. The distance *f* from the outside of the top plate to the edge of the hole should be at least *f<sub>min</sub>*, which is equal to *d/2 + 1/8*. The distance *g* between vertical plates should be at least *d + 1*, or more if required for maintenance. The top plate may project radially beyond vertical plates by no more than 1/2 in.

## Vertical Plates
 
The vertical plates are the plates that connect the top plate to the shell or column. The vertical plates should have a thickness *j* and a width *k*. The width may vary for tapered plates. The height *h* of the vertical plates should be high enough to distribute the anchor bolt load to the shell or column without overstressing it. The height depends on the design load *P*, the eccentricity *e*, the shell radius *R<sub>s</sub>*, the shell thickness *t*, and a reduction factor *Z*. The reduction factor accounts for the effect of chair stiffness on stress distribution. A formula for calculating *h* is given in [Part VII Anchor Bolt Chairs W - Apiexam](https://apiexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AISI-Anchor-Chair-Design.pdf).
 
## Welds
 
The welds are used to join the top plate, vertical plates, and shell or column. The weld size *w* should be sufficient to resist the total load *W*, which is composed of horizontal load *W<sub>H</sub>* and vertical load *W<sub>V</sub>*. The horizontal load is due to shear force from anchor bolt load, while the vertical load is due to bending moment from anchor bolt load. A formula for calculating *w* is given in [Part VII Anchor Bolt Chairs W - Apiexam](https://apiexam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AISI-Anchor-Chair-Design.pdf).
 
## Conclusion
 
Anchor bolt chairs are important structures for supporting anchor bolts in shell supports. They should be designed according to *AISI E 1, Volume II, Part VII*, which provides guidelines for determining the dimensions and stresses of top plate, vertical plates, and welds. By following these guidelines, anchor bolt chairs can ensure a safe and efficient load transfer from anchor bolts to shells.
