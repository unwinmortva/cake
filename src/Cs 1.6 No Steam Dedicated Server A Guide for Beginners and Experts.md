If you want to host your own Counter-Strike 1.6 server for free, you might be wondering how to make it compatible with both Steam and Non-Steam players. In this article, we will show you how to set up a Cs 1.6 No Steam Dedicated Server using HLDS (Half-Life Dedicated Server) and dproto (a metamod plugin that allows Non-Steam clients to join Steam servers).
 
## Step 1: Download and Install HLDS
 
The first step is to download and install HLDS, which is the official tool for creating and running dedicated servers for Half-Life and its mods. You can download it from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/90/CounterStrike/) or from [csdownload.me](https://csdownload.me). After downloading, extract the files to a folder of your choice and run hlds.exe.

You will see a window where you can configure your server settings, such as game type, map, name, password, etc. Choose Counter-Strike as the game and select a map from the list. You can also customize other options according to your preferences. Click Start Server to launch your server.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install dproto
 
The next step is to download and install dproto, which is a metamod plugin that allows Non-Steam clients to join Steam servers. You can download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3y51wuuvlr8...). After downloading, extract the files to your HLDS folder, where you will find a subfolder called cstrike.
