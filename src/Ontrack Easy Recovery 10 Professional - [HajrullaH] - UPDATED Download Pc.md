- **Data Recovery:** This option allows you to recover your lost or deleted files from various types of storage devices. You can choose from three different recovery modes: Quick Scan, Deep Scan and Deleted Volume Scan. Quick Scan is the fastest mode that can recover files that were recently deleted or lost due to simple file system errors. Deep Scan is a more thorough mode that can recover files that were lost due to more complex issues such as formatting, partitioning or corruption. Deleted Volume Scan is a mode that can recover files from deleted or missing partitions or volumes on your hard drive or SSD. To use this option, you need to select the device or drive that you want to scan from the list on the right side of the screen and click on "Start". The software will then scan your device or drive and display a list of recoverable files in a tree view. You can preview some of the files by clicking on them and then select the ones that you want to recover by checking their boxes. You can also filter the files by name, type or date using the options on the top of the screen. Once you have selected all the files that you want to recover, click on "Recover" and choose a destination folder where you want to save them.
- **File Repair:** This option allows you to repair damaged or corrupt photos and video files that cannot be opened or played normally. You can choose from two different repair modes: Photo Repair and Video Repair. Photo Repair can fix common issues such as pixelation, distortion, color shift or 8cf37b1e13
