You will see a progress bar on your screen and hear a beep sound from your radio when it is finished.

## Step 5: Test Your Radio
 
After programming your radio, you may want to test it to make sure it works properly. Here are some tips on how to test your radio.
 
- Check the battery level and charge it if needed.
- Adjust the volume and squelch knobs to your preference.
- Select a memory channel or a VFO frequency that you want to use.
- Press the PTT button and speak into the microphone. Release the button when you finish speaking.
